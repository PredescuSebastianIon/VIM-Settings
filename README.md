# Tutorial for this vim configuration


After you've cloned this repository in you home using the next commands:

```bash
    cd ~
    git clone "https://github.com/PredescuSebastianIon/VIM-Settings.git"
```

You must move the "vimrc_settings_backup" file into your home and rename it to work with the next commands:

```bash
    cd ~/.vim
    cp vimrc_settings_backup ../.vimrc
```

Now everything should be set perfectly fine.
Enjoy this vim configuration!!
